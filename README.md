# html-make.sh
 A script intended to enable templating of HTML without the use of javascript. Makes use of common GNU tools.

 ## this is a work in progress
 Currently, this script only supports one component, one template, and one final file. Soon, support for multiple of each will be added. Further down the road is nested components and component parameters.

 Documentation and samples are in the works, as well.
