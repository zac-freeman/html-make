# html-make.sh
A Perl (five) script designed to enable templating of HTML without the use of javascript. Truthfully, it could be used to enable templating for any kind of text file, but HTML is one of few languages that could make use of templating and has no native support for such a thing (Rest in Peace HTML Imports, 2011-2016ish)

## this is a work in progress
Currently, this project is in an experimental phase. As of the last update to this README, the html-make.pl script supports populating a hash of templates with their declared dependencies. The initial goal is to read files at a given location, populate them, name them, and write them to another given location.

Documentation and samples are in the works, as well.

## the graveyard
The graveyard is where I put things that should be deleted. In a sense, this codebase is haunted by dead code.
